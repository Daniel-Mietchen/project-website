                that can be used by anyone in order to dramatically improve the discoverability of research results.
                <br><br>
                We are going to provide a large-scale system of open, interactive and interlinked knowledge maps
                spanning all fields of research. Around these maps, we will develop a space for collective knowledge organisation 
                and exploration, <strong>connecting researchers, students, librarians, journalists, practitioners and citizens.</strong>
