                    </h3>
                    <p class="newsitem-p">
                        Open Knowledge Maps premiered in an exciting session at Mozilla Festival 2015 - and this year we are returning with an action-packed program including demos 
                        and a hands-on session. We will demonstrate how you can use OKMaps not only to discover the literature that you need but also to improve your understanding 
                        of the structure of your research area. Join us in London from October 28 to 30!

                    <p class="newsitem-p">
                        Over the summer, we have been working hard to provide you with visualizations that cover broader content sources. 
                        Now, our integration of PubMed and the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is in its final stage and will be released by the end of October. 
                        This means that you will soon be able to search within 35 million articles. Stay tuned!
