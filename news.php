                            a coalition of more than 60 organisations aiming to 
                            create an open annotation layer over all scholarly knowledge. 
                            At Open Knowledge Maps, we support this goal, because we believe 
                            that open and collaborative processes will change the way we explore 
                            and discover research. As a first measure, we have enabled open annotation 
                            of all PDFs within our interface by integrating Hypothes.is into our 
                            "Preview PDF" window.

                            We are happy to announce that Open Knowledge Maps is now connected to one of the largest academic search engines in the world: BASE.<br><br>

                            For the first time you are able to visualize a research topic in any discipline. In addition, you can now search within different types of resources, including datasets and software. We would like to thank the <a href="https://www.base-search.net/about/en/about_team.php?menu=2" target="_blank">BASE team</a> for their outstanding support in making this happen!<br><br>

                            We have also spent a lot of time improving the naming of the sub-areas to make the concepts in a field more visible - which means that this update improves our existing PubMed integration too.<br><br>

                            Great things have happened following our launch of the DOAJ and PubMed 
                            integrations. We saw a broad coverage on the web, including an appearance on the Reddit front 
                            page in early November and an article in c't magazine. More than 44,000 people visited 
                            Open Knowledge Maps in November, and almost 25,000 maps have been created to date.<br><br>
                            We have also introduced Open Knowledge Maps at numerous events including MozFest, OpenCon & OpenCon Berlin, and NetzPat Vienna to name just a few. In total, over 230 people attended our workshops and sessions. The positive feedback was overwhelming and we want to thank our emerging community for their great support. Loads of you have posted great comments, written articles and spread Open Knowledge Maps in your respective communities, posted issues and ideas on Github, or become part of the team and advisory board. A BIG THANK YOU! We are happy to see everyone getting involved and we are also thinking about new ways to make it even easier for you to be part of the Open Knowledge Maps community in the future. Together we can revolutionize discovery!

                        <p class="newsitem-p">
                            Over the summer, we have been working hard to provide you with visualizations that 
                            cover broader content sources. Now, our integration of PubMed and the Directory of 
                            Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is finally here.<br><br>
                            This means that you are now able to search 
                            within more than 28 million articles. In addition, we have completely overhauled our 
                            design and improved the user experience considerably - including the integration of 
                            the open annotation software Hypothes.is in our PDF preview. Try it out and let us 
                            know what you think!

                            Open Knowledge Maps premiered in an exciting session at Mozilla Festival 2015 - and this year we are returning with an action-packed program including demos 
                            and a hands-on session.<br><br>
                            We will demonstrate how you can use OKMaps not only to discover the literature that you need but also to improve your understanding 
                            of the structure of your research area. Join us in London from October 28 to 30!
