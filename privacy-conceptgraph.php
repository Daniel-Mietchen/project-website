                <p>We use the information collected through our website to provide, maintain, protect and improve our services, analyze usage patterns and develop new services, and protect open knowledge maps and our users. In addition, we use the collected data for the achievement of our association's purpose (see imprint:  <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://openknowledgemaps.org/imprint#legalnotice">https://openknowledgemaps.org/imprint#legalnotice</a>).

                </p>

                <h3>What type of data is collected</h3>
                <p>Collected data includes</p>
                <ul style="list-style: disc; margin-left:20px;">
                  <li>Cookie information in order to be able to deduce multiple accesses of the same user (s. Cookies).</li>
                  <li>Click data; these describe which visualization elements (e.g. nodes, textual elements or filter functions) the user has interacted with, mainly by mouse clicks, and allow identification of typical or unintended interaction patterns.</li>
                  <li>Timestamps; these describe the times of the user interactions in order to be able to conclude interaction sequences.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How is the data used?</h3>
                <p>
                The initially pseudo-anonymized data is collected to evaluate the performance, usability and usage patterns of a graph visualization integrated into the Open Knowledge Maps search platform. At the end of the one-month experiment time window and before further processing, the data is completely anonymized. The data and the resulting results will be used for scientific purposes (including scientific publication), teaching and improving the visualization and similar services that promote the discoverability of scientific knowledge for the production of new knowledge and its use in teaching.
                </p>

                <h3>Where is the data stored?</h3>
                <p>Collected data is stored in data centers in Germany and Austria. There is no disclosure, or order processing by third parties.
                </p>

                <h3>How long is the data stored?</h3>
                <p>The storage takes place until the exhaustion of the processing purpose, unless in addition there are legal or (contractual) storage requirements or (predominantly) legitimate interests which justify a longer storage (e.g. for the assertion or defense of legal claims).
                </p>
